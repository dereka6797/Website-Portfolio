My very basic and "sleek" portfolio website primarily in the most basic of languages. I had started out using React, however, this was much quicker for me for the time being. The actual project (portfolio) section is not filled yet because I'm working on the styles of it, just as well I'm doing the same thing for the experience section. There is a signup page, though that's made using Pug, of which I'm new to so it'll be a little bit until I'm finished.
